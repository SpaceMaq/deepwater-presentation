            <p>A team of designers, finance consultants, and coders</p>
            <p>We want to find hidden water sources using nasa data and AI/ML</p>

            <p>We want to solve the world’s water problem by helping people such
              as farmers, refugees in water depleted areas  to find water around them.</p>
            <p>We are a team of coders, designers, finance consultants with a
              vision to create a “For Purpose foundation” (Non Profit Foundation)
              that uses open source NASA data to allow people to find water
              around them no matter who or where they are.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Our vision is to solve first world and third world water problems.
              By using our app we allow a refugee to go to a location which
              would allow them to dig for water near their camp. The app using
              the DATA from NASA would make this easy to use and accessible.
              We could help a farmer in either the developed world or developing
              world with the same issue</p>

            <h2>Why is it important</h2>
            <p style="color:black">85% of the world population lives in the driest half of the planet</p>
            <p>Droughts are 5% of natural disasters but account for 25% of people effected</p>
            <p>783 million do not have access to clean water</p>
            <p>We can find other planets can we find water closer to home</p>

            <h2>What we tested</h2>
            <p>Does the surface temprature change with sub surface water?</p>
            <p>Short version: Not with the data we can get</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Difficult to detect a few feet in the ground</li>
              <li>Resolution too low. 1km Squares</li>
              <li>Sparse existing water monitoring points</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Maybe when combined with other sources in the cube</p>
