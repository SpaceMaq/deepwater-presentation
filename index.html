            <p>We are a team of coders, designers, finance consultants with a vision to create a “For Purpose foundation” (Non Profit Foundation) that uses open source NASA  data to allow people to find water around them no matter who or where they are.</p>

          <section data-transition="slide">
            <p>Our vision is to solve first world and third world water problems. By using our app  we allow a refugee to go to a location which would allow them to dig for water near their camp. The app using the DATA from NASA would make this easy to use and accessible. And we could help a farmer in either the developed world or developing world with the same issue</p>
