            <p>We want to solve the world’s water problem by helping people such
              as farmers, refugees in water depleted areas  to find water around them.</p>
            <p>We are a team of coders, designers, finance consultants with a
              vision to create a “For Purpose foundation” (Non Profit Foundation)
              that uses open source NASA data to allow people to find water
              around them no matter who or where they are.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>Our vision is to solve first world and third world water problems.
              By using our app we allow a refugee to go to a location which
              would allow them to dig for water near their camp. The app using
              the DATA from NASA would make this easy to use and accessible.
              We could help a farmer in either the developed world or developing
              world with the same issue</p>

            <p>85% of the world population lives in the driest half of the planet.</p>
            <p>783 million people do not have access to clean water</p>
            <p>Almost 2.5 billion do not have access to adequate sanitation</p>
